# QA Execution Documentation — forage-midas

## Purpose
Record the QA execution scope, evidence, defects and limitations for **forage-midas**.

## Execution scope
- Source/repository structure inspection
- Build and dependency configuration
- Existing automated tests and CI
- Functional and negative test scenarios
- Security-sensitive configuration review
- Deployment/runtime configuration where applicable

## Execution record
| Area | Expected | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Structure/source | No unexplained broken references | GitHub source inspection |
| Build | Project build succeeds when executable | Build/CI evidence when available |
| Automated tests | Existing tests pass | Test/CI evidence when available |
| Functional/negative paths | Valid input works; invalid input is controlled | Source/tests |
| Security | No confirmed credential exposure | Configuration/source review |
| Deployment | Workflows/configuration are valid | Repository configuration |

## Defect policy
Only reproducible or directly evidenced defects are classified as defects. Empty, README-only, or incomplete repositories are recorded as limitations rather than given fabricated fixes.

## Execution status
**QA documentation completed.** Runtime execution is reported only where a reproducible test, build, CI job, or runtime check provides evidence.

## Limitations
Further execution requires the repository to contain an executable application, dependency configuration, or runnable test suite.
